Car Builder

Car Builder is a fully customizable 2D drag-racing sandbox built in Godot 4.5.1. Design engines from the ground up, tune gear ratios and suspension, choose body types and materials, and race your creation against an AI opponent that uses the exact same setup.
This project focuses on realism, detailed tuning, and flexible experimentation with a wide range of car and engine configurations.
